# Instructions

During your interaction with the user, if you find anything reusable in this project (e.g. version of a library, model name), especially about a fix to a mistake you made or a correction you received, you should take note in the `Lessons` section in the `.cursorrules` file so you will not make the same mistake again. 

You should also use the `.cursorrules` file as a Scratchpad to organize your thoughts. Especially when you receive a new task, you should first review the content of the Scratchpad, clear old different task if necessary, first explain the task, and plan the steps you need to take to complete the task. You can use todo markers to indicate the progress, e.g.
[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2

Also update the progress of the task in the Scratchpad when you finish a subtask.
Especially when you finished a milestone, it will help to improve your depth of task accomplishment to use the Scratchpad to reflect and plan.
The goal is to help you maintain a big picture as well as the progress of the task. Always refer to the Scratchpad when you plan the next step.

do not touch header files.

## Current Task: Update Recording Management
Goal: Modify the codebase to save recordings only after successful transcription and store them with transcription data.

Steps:
[X] 1. Create a Recording model to store recording data with transcription
[X] 2. Update AudioRecorder to handle temporary recordings
[X] 3. Update IndicatorWindow to handle transcription and saving
[X] 4. Update ContentView to display transcribed recordings
[X] 5. Add database storage for recordings

Key Changes:
- AudioRecorder: Added temporary recording storage and cleanup
- IndicatorWindow: Now handles transcription completion and saving to permanent storage
- ContentView: Updated to show transcribed recordings with timestamps
- New Recording model with transcription data and JSON storage

Next Steps:
- Test the changes
- Consider adding error handling for failed transcriptions
- Add duration information to recordings
