## Whisper Models

You can download Whisper model files (`.bin`) from the [Whisper.cpp Hugging Face repository](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/tree/main). Place the downloaded `.bin` files in the app's models directory. On first launch, the app will attempt to copy a default model automatically, but you can add more models manually.

## How to Verify Model Auto-Repair

To check that the auto-repair feature is working:

1. Delete all `.bin` model files from the models directory. You can open this folder from the app's Settings ("Open Folder" button next to "Models Directory").
2. Restart the app.
3. The default model (`ggml-tiny.en.bin`) should be restored automatically, and the model selector will no longer be empty.

If you want to add more models, simply download them from the link above and place them in the models directory.
